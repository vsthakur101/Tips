## Overview

Feature flags enable conditional activation of features in your application without requiring code deployments. They are particularly useful for:
- Gradual rollouts (e.g., enabling features for specific users or groups).
- A/B testing.
- Quick rollback of problematic features.
- Enabling development/debugging features.
